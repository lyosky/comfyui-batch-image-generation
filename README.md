```bash
git clone git@github.com:rsandagon/comfyui-batch-image-generation.git

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How to download COmfyUI workflows in api format?**
From `comfyanonymous` notes, simply enable to "enable dev mode options"
in the settings of the UI (gear beside the "Queue Size: "). This will add
a button on the UI to save workflows in api format.

**How to connect to ComfyUI running in a different server?**
You may modify the `var COMFTY_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8188"` from `app.js` to point to the server. Note that you will be needing to configure the websocket connection and the API fetchsing depending on the CORS support and authentication.
